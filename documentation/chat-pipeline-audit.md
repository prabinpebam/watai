# Chat run pipeline — audit & latency benchmark (2026-06-30)

Triggered by: **"I'm not getting any chat response at all."** This records the full
prompt→render pipeline, benchmarks every step against the live production endpoint, identifies the
root cause of the no-response failure, and documents the fix.

## TL;DR

- **The model and memory layers are healthy.** Embedding is 0.7–2.2s; gpt-5.4 generation is 1–18s.
- **Root cause of "no response":** the Azure **Responses API intermittently stalls — producing zero
  output — when `code_interpreter` is offered alongside the custom function tools (`web_search`,
  `generate_image`).** The stalled stream hangs until the 120s `aiFetch` timeout aborts it; the run
  then finalizes as an **empty `error` message**, which the UI shows as no reply.
- **It is intermittent and upstream**, reproduced with direct orchestrator calls (no memory code in
  the path). Yesterday's runs hit the fast path; today's two runs both hit the stall.
- **It is NOT caused by the memory deploy** — `withTimeout` caps memory at 3s; the failure is in the
  tool-enabled Responses call.
- **Fix shipped:** a first-token **watchdog + clean retry** in the worker. If an agent attempt yields
  nothing within 45s, it is aborted and retried from scratch (safe — nothing was emitted, so no
  duplication). The intermittent stall now self-heals instead of hanging 120s and failing silently.

## The pipeline (server-authoritative + SignalR)

## Per-step benchmark (live endpoint `ai-project-deployments-resource`, model `gpt-5.4`)

Measured with `api/scripts/pipeline-bench.ts` (real calls via the same code the worker uses) and
App Insights request telemetry.

| Step | Measurement | Source |
|--|--|--|
| Submit run `POST /threads/{id}/runs` | ~519ms avg | App Insights `thread-runs` |
| SignalR `negotiate` | ~118ms | App Insights |
| Queue → worker pickup (cold) | ~13s | queue InsertedOn→Executing |
| Queue → worker pickup (warm) | <1s | storage-queue polling |
| Load run/thread/history (Cosmos) | ~0.1–0.4s | est. (deps sampled out) |
| **Embedding (memory query)** | **cold 2.2s / warm 0.7–1.7s** | bench Phase A |
| Agent gen, no tools — TTFT | 0.9–2.5s | bench Phase B |
| Agent gen, no tools — total | 1–18s (length-dependent) | bench Phase B |
| Reasoning effort (minimal→high) | ~1.8–2.1s (negligible) | bench Phase C |
| `web_search` alone | 1.6s | bench Phase D |
| `generate_image` alone | 1.3s | bench Phase D |
| `code_interpreter` alone | 6.5s (container spin-up) | bench Phase D |
| **`code_interpreter` + function tool** | **5–31s … or HANG → 120s abort** | bench Phase D |
| Flush cadence (SignalR push) | every 250ms | worker `DEFAULT_FLUSH_MS` |

**End-to-end:**
- Healthy, warm, no tools: **~3–22s**.
- Healthy, warm, with tools (fast path): **~5–35s**.
- **Stall path (code_interpreter + function tools): hangs to the 120s timeout → run `error`, empty
  message → no response rendered.**

## Failure analysis (ground truth)

Cosmos `runs` + `messages` for the two runs that prompted this report:

```
run 74a6629f 01:57:55  status=error  tools=[web_search,generate_image,code_interpreter,file_search]
            ERR="This operation was aborted"  → assistant msg len=0   (worker ran 123s then aborted)
run abfb19ac 01:54:39  status=error  same tools  ERR="This operation was aborted"  → msg len=0 (~135s)
```

Yesterday's runs (20:06–20:11), same tool set, all `complete` with content (len 83–127, `toolCalls=0`).

Tool-isolation benchmark (40s abort), two consecutive runs showing the **nondeterminism**:

| tools | run 1 | run 2 |
|--|--|--|
| web_search only | 1.6s ✅ | — |
| generate_image only | 1.3s ✅ | — |
| code_interpreter only | 6.5s ✅ | — |
| web_search + code_interpreter | — | **hang → abort 40s** ❌ |
| generate_image + code_interpreter | — | 31s ⚠️ |
| web_search + generate_image (no CI) | — | 3s ✅ |
| all 3 | **hang → abort** ❌ | 5s ✅ |

**Conclusion:** combining the `code_interpreter` server tool with custom function tools destabilizes
the Responses stream (intermittent zero-output stall). `aiFetch`'s 120s default timeout
([api/src/ai/http.ts](../api/src/ai/http.ts)) then aborts it, and the worker finalizes the run as an
empty `error`. The memory query embedding (my recent change) is bounded to 3s by `withTimeout` and is
not in the failure path.

## Fix

First-token **watchdog + clean retry** in the worker
([api/src/application/runWorker.ts](../api/src/application/runWorker.ts)):

- `streamAgentWithRetry` wraps `runAgent`. Each attempt runs under an `AbortController`; if **no
  event** arrives within `firstTokenWatchdogMs` (default **45s** — above the slowest healthy
  first-token time), the attempt is aborted.
- A stalled attempt is **retried from scratch** only while **nothing has been emitted** (so the
  consumer's accumulated state is untouched and no output is duplicated). `maxAgentAttempts` default
  **2**. Once any event is produced, the watchdog clears and the stream runs to completion normally;
  a mid-stream failure (after output) is re-thrown, not retried.
- Result: an intermittent zero-output stall self-heals within ~45s instead of failing the run after
  120s. Tests: clean retry on stall → `complete`; persistent stall → `error` with no duplicate
  output ([runWorker.test.ts](../api/src/application/runWorker.test.ts)).

## Recommendations / follow-ups

1. **Reduce/observe the tool combination.** Investigate offering `code_interpreter` without the
   custom function tools in the same request (or as a separate iteration). Track the Azure Responses
   API behavior; this is an upstream instability.
2. **Lower the hard Responses timeout** (currently 120s) toward the watchdog so a true hang fails
   faster even on the final attempt.
3. **Disable trace/dependency sampling temporarily for deep diagnosis** — `host.json`
   `samplingSettings` currently drops worker traces and dependency timings, which is why per-step
   server timing had to be reconstructed via a local benchmark.
4. **Surface a fast, friendly error** to the UI when all attempts stall, instead of a silent empty
   bubble.

Regenerate the benchmark: `cd api && npx tsx scripts/pipeline-bench.ts` (reads `WATAI_PROBE_BASEURL` /
`WATAI_PROBE_KEY`). Raw numbers: `documentation/memory-system/pipeline-bench-report.{md,json}`.
